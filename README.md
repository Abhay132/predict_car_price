**Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°**
Overview
This project predicts used car prices using machine learning based on features like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It helps buyers and sellers estimate fair market values.

**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Web Deployment (Flask/Django - optional)
Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.
EDA: Analyzing price trends and feature correlations.
Model Training: Testing different algorithms & tuning hyperparameters.
Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score to measure accuracy.
Deployment: Web app integration (if applicable).
**Results**
Key factors: brand, year, mileage, and fuel type.
10-15% error margin in price estimation.
**Future Scope**
Real-time price updates
Deep learning for better accuracy
Mobile app integration
